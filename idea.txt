make it easy to select elements
format:
space to separate segments
first selector can be:
- id (without using a hashtag because it isn't needed),
- unique class (with .). unique classes can be found with uniqueClasses()
- tagname (by default starting within html, choose head or body). to select an element from a list use tagname + index + 1 (index is 0 by default). you can also just use index without tagname.
example:
    el('id div div2 1') as opposed to document.getElementById(id).getElementsByTagName('div')[0].getElementsByTagName('div')[1].children[]
    gets element by id
    then gets first div
    then gets second div
    then gets first element

    to do this with a unique class:
        el('.class div div2 1')

it doesn't allow selecting multiple elements in one command.
although it is possible to make such a function, this would make the pattern too complex, defeating the purpose.
