make it easy to select elements
format:
space to separate segments
first selector can be:
- id (without using a hashtag because it isn't needed),
- unique class. unique classes can be found with uniqueClasses()
- tagname (by default starting within html, choose head or body). to select an element from a list use tagname + index + 1 (index is 0 by default). you can also just use index without tagname.
example:
    el('id div div2 1')
    gets element by id
    then gets first div
    then gets second div
    then gets first element

it doesn't allow selecting multiple elements in one command.
although it is possible to make such a function, this would make the pattern too complex, defeating the purpose.
