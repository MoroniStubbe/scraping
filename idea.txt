make it easy to select elements (for web scraping)

example:
assign an id to the element you want to get the path to (default = 'get')
then use const path = getPath('yourId') to get the path.
now you can use getElement(path) to get the element

note:
it doesn't allow selecting multiple elements in one command.
although it is possible to make such a function, this would make the usage too complex, defeating the purpose.
